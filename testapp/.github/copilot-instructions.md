This project is a React app for onboarding users to connect their Google Calendar. It communicates with a Python backend for authentication and Google OAuth. Prioritize code that is simple, clear, and easy to test. Show error and success messages in the UI. Use REST API calls to the backend for all authentication and calendar connection actions.
